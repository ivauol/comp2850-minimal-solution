**Module**: COMP2850 Human-Computer Interaction
**Activity**: Low-risk needs finding (peer interviews)
**Date**: 2025-12-02
**Researcher**: Iva Ristic

## Purpose

We are conducting short peer interviews (15 minutes) to understand how people use task managers and how to make them accessible

## What You'll Do

You will be working with a task manager to see how long and how easily certain tasks are done (adding/removing tasks, navigating the task manager, etc)

## Data Collected

- **What I will collect**:
  - Pseudonymised notes (e.g., "Participant A said...")
  - Timestamps of interview
  - Contextual tags (e.g., "Uses keyboard only", "Prefers dark mode")

- **What I will NOT collect**:
  - Your name (unless you want credit in acknowledgements)
  - Student ID number
  - Email address
  - Any other personally identifiable information (PII)

## Data Storage

- **Where**: Local Git repository on my laptop
- **Who can access**: Me, module teaching staff
- **How long**: Until end of Semester 1 (January 2025), then deleted OR anonymised

## Your Rights (UK GDPR / Data Protection Act 2018)

- **Right to withdraw**: You can stop at any time, no explanation needed
- **Right to access**: You can ask to see your data (I'll show you my notes)
- **Right to erasure**: You can request I delete your data (email me with interview date/pseudonym)
- **Right to complain**: Contact University Data Protection Officer if concerned: dpo@leeds.ac.uk

## Consent Confirmation

Before starting, I will ask:
- Have I explained the purpose clearly?
- Do you understand what data I'll collect?
- Do you know you can stop at any time?
- Do you consent to participate?

**Verbal consent is sufficient** for this low-risk activity. If you say "yes", I'll note:
- Date/time: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
- Pseudonym assigned: [e.g., "Participant A"]
- Consent confirmed: [Initials]
